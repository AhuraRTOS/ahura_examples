/**
 * @file os_main_queue.c
 * @brief Ahura kernel example: message queue (os_queue_*), both storage kinds.
 *
 * os_main is the producer: it sends an incrementing value every 300 ms. A
 * higher-priority consumer task blocks in os_queue_receive() and drains each
 * item as soon as it arrives.
 *
 * Two queues carry the same items, to show the only thing that differs between
 * them, which is where the item buffer comes from:
 *
 *   - os_main_static_queue  OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_STATIC: sized and initialized at compile time,
 *                     usable with nothing to call first.
 *   - os_main_dynamic_queue OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_DYNAMIC + os_queue_init_dynamic(), buffer taken
 *                     from the kernel heap, so the capacity could just as well be a
 *                     run-time value.
 *
 * Every send and receive call is identical for both. Copy this file into the
 * application source tree as os_main.c to run it; needs OS_CONFIG_QUEUE_ENABLE=1
 * in os_config.h (the default), and OS_CONFIG_ALLOC_ENABLE=1 for the dynamic
 * half.
